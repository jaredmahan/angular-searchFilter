# angular-SearchFilter
An external table filtering control. This directive will access the table's column data
and create a flexible UI that will allow users to filter table data.

## Getting Started

## Cloning the Project
If you are looking to contribute to the project, below are the steps needed to get the project up and running:
- Ensure you have node.js installed on your local machine (the latest version should include npm)
- Install an lightweight IDE. I used Visual Studio Code
- Go to the directory where you cloned the project and run the following commands
  - `npm install`
    - This will install all dependencies from the package.json into your node_modules folder
  - `bower install`
  -   This will install all dependencies from the bower.json into your bower_components folder
  
## Third Parties
Currently I am using a variety of plugins to build the node application. Below is a list of the components
currently used in the application:

| Component             | Application                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| express               | serving up pages               |
| jade                  | node.js template engine        |
| bootstrap             | responsive css freamework      |
| bundle-up3            | bundling and minification      |
| gulp                  | task management                |
| gulp-main-bower-files | building out bower_components  |
